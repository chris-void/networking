mid term exam next thurs

**tuesday review**

sliding windows


**reliable**

+ stop and wait (idle rq)
+ pipeline RQ (selective repeat, go back n)

missing packet - lost / corrupted

size = min (capacity*RTT, buffer size )

GO BACK N
rev windows size -> 1

selective repeat
rev windows size -> k

## Go Back N
sws = k
rws = 1

fig

## Selective repeat

sws = k
rws = k

seq # need at least 2k *?*

## Challenges 
**TCP:**
FIFO
1. non_FIFO

2. timer ~ RTT
rtt is hard to estimate

3. sws = (b*d, buffer size)
      (effiency, flow control)

d = rtt, changing
b = capacity share
buffer size .... dependends on the connections at the time

overshoot - congestion
undershoot - inefficient

**sws is changing**



## TCP

+ CO reliable: GBN / SR
+ buffered byte transfer:
+ demux: distinguish VCs, virtual channels(virtual connections) - src / dest [ip,port]
+ bi-directional (each side has a rw and a sw)
+ fc + cc(flow control, congestion control)

**TCP header**

seg dont have ip addr, is from IP

**GBN**
comunication ACK

3 dup ACK - fast retransmite
