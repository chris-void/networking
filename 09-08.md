# Connectivity

## Indirect connectivity

+ switches (net core)
+ hosts/ end-systems (net edge)
+ packets (msg send and receive)
+ store and forward
+ routers / gateways (nodes connect networks)
+ ISP: customer-provider link / peering link

### Addressing, Routing

# Cost-effective Resrc Sharing

###multiplex

1. FDM (frequency division multiplexing) - divide bandwidth to more small bandwidthes
bandwidth (range of frequency)   HZ,   bit rate -  bit/sec

2. TDM (time division multiplexing)
over time send frame of bits - frame includes time slots

bitrate = frame_rate * #bits / slot

**Disadvantage** if someone is not using it, it is wasted

packet switch network
circuit switch network

Q:
speed:  C
packetsize: S 

packet transmission time = packet(bit) / (bit/sec)

one bit time = 1(bit) / C (bit/sec)

## scheduling decision

### buffer overflow
congestion

lambda & C
+ buffer to solve the burst problem
+ avg waiting time (traffic intensity) lamdba/C

**fig** traffic intensity - slow+ fast 

process - process chanels

we want the chanel perfect

---

between processes - virtual channels

**reliability:**

no loss
nocorraption
in order
no duplication

**errors:**

bit errors:
    error detection     / coding 
    correct errors    -
                        \ retransmission


packet errors:
    drop cuz of congestion
    bit error

node failure
