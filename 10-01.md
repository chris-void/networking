# p2p more scaliable

Reason

linear vs sub-linear

more client ...... more capcity

share download and upload 

### File distribution

BitTorrent

+ seed
+ tracker
+ torrent

neighbour peer - establish tcp connections

direct servers - join the torrent, get a list of peers that part of the torrent .....

---

## piece  selection (chumk) - which chumk should I download first ?

1. equalize the chumk ...... chumk 1~n is distributed 
2. 

## peer selection - which obe shoulf I serve first ?

1. serve you if you serve me - measure the rate of served, ranking...

*top-4-provider*

randomly select to serve one - test you if you will serve me back

optimistic "unchoke"

---

torrent(file name) -> IP addr of existing peers
              name resolution

same like **DNS**
hostname ->IP addr
syn-ed db -> c/s model

key -> val
DHT?
peer -> assign Id
========

key ---hash-----> assigned ID

worest case -> query resolves number of peers

faster -> **shortcuts**

### peer churn

## Skype

usr name -> ip

state - 

**stateless** - past activity
http - cookies, caching-> make it state
DNS caching


# Chapter 3

## transport level

-------
| app |
-------
| TL  |
-------

**UDP**
**TCP**

**transport layer** - what it can do ?

app msg -> trans segment ->

MUX - multiplex -> merging msg from app
DEMUX - demultiplex


**UDP**
MUX - DEST port#
DEMUX - error detec(if msg is broken, drop it not send to app layer)

*checksum*
