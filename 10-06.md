**udp checksum**

## udp
connectionless - no state


##tansport layer

### TCP

+ Full duplex
+ Flow control
+ Congestion control

## Basic of reliable transmission

stateless
best efffect


## NOTE

FIFO 

1. do not send at a high rate to avoid loss(flow control)
2. implement error detection
3. implement error correction
4. no duplication

*no out of order*

+ if data packet is lost / corrapted? - ARQ
+ if ack is lost? - sand data pck again, drop duplicated



RTO < RTT => premature retransmission -> duplicate -> waste of channel capcity -> lower GOODPUT(tput to deliever new data)

*throughputs*
*gooputs*

RTO > RTT => slow to recover -> under_utilize channel

stop and wait protocol
idleRQ
