Propagation delay T_p = 2* 100/200 ms

### transmission
processing delay
T_x = 1000bit / C


C = 1Mbps 2ms

C = 1Gbps 1ms


## Link utilization
 fration of time link is buzy transmitting
 throughput capcity

 = throughput/capcity


C = 1Mbps
utilization = 50%

probagation delay - huge

### HTTP resposne msg

client web page

http -  stateless protocol
C-S tcp based , intreactive, pull, state-less
